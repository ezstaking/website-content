Staking is a way to earn cryptocurrency rewards by holding a certain amount of a digital asset (like Cosmos coins) and supporting the validation of transactions on a blockchain network. 

With EZ Staking, you can delegate your Cosmos coins to our own validators, who will validate transactions on multiple Cosmos networks and earn block rewards on your behalf. This means you can earn a passive income without having to run your own validator node or worry about complex maintenance. 

By delegating your coins to our own validators, you're supporting the security and growth of the Cosmos network and earning rewards in the process.
