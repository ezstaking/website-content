Yes, you can cancel your staking account on EZ Staking. As a non-custodial staking provider, EZ Staking does not hold your private keys or have control over your funds. You are free to cancel your staking account at any time, and we encourage you to do so if you no longer want to participate in staking or if you experience any issues with your staking account.

To cancel your staking account on EZ Staking, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the EZ Staking website and log in to your account.
2. Click on the "My Account" section and select "Staking Accounts" from the dropdown menu.
3. Find the staking account you want to cancel and click on the "Cancel Staking" button.
4. Confirm that you want to cancel the staking account by clicking on the "Confirm Cancel" button.

Once you’ve cancelled your staking account, you will no longer be able to access the staking dashboard and will not receive staking rewards. However, you will still have access to your funds and other account information.

If you have any issues or concerns about cancelling your staking account, you can contact EZ Staking’s support team for assistance.
