Yes, you can use EZ Staking from a VPN or proxy server.

EZ Staking is designed to be a non-custodial platform, allowing you to interact with your wallet and staking services through a secure and private connection.

As long as your VPN or proxy server does not interfere with the connectivity to our platform, you can use EZ Staking without any issues.

For added convenience, you can also access EZ Staking through our user-friendly web app, EZ Staking App, which allows you to manage your staking activity and settings with ease.
