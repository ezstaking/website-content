Staking is a way to earn rewards by supporting the growth and development of a blockchain network. With EZ Staking, we're making it easy for you to stake your cryptocurrency on multiple Cosmos networks.

**How Does Staking Work?**

Staking involves a combination of several key components:

* **Validators**: Our validators are responsible for verifying and validating transactions, as well as creating new blocks.
* **Staking**: You lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (called the "stake") to support our validators.
* **Block Rewards**: Our validators earn a portion of the block rewards, which are then distributed to stakers like you.
