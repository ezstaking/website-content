EZ Staking takes several measures to protect against certain risks:

* Uninterrupted connectivity: We use multiple high-availability nodes to ensure continuous connectivity to the blockchain, minimizing the risk of node failures or maintenance downtime.
* Regular software updates: Our infrastructure is always updated with the latest security patches and bug fixes, ensuring the platform remains secure and reliable.
* Diversified validator nodes: We operate a diversified pool of validator nodes across multiple networks, reducing the impact of any individual node failure.
* Strong wallet integration: We use reputable and secure wallet providers, and prioritize strong wallet integration to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to your funds.
* Refund policy: In the event of a soft slash, we have a refund policy in place to ensure that users receive refunds for any staked assets affected by the slash.

By implementing these measures, we strive to provide a secure and reliable staking experience for our users.
